# 3D Printed case

There is a 3D printed case designed for the Smart Thermostat prototype board v0.5.2.
It aims to fit the thermostat PCB on a Honeywell's UWP Mounting system, common for T-series thermostats.
This allows quick swapping for those with such a thermostat already installed and snaps into UWP without screws.

Attached are two STP files (front and back), which use the following additional components:

* For PCB mounting 3x M2 screws and heat inserts
* For front+back coupling 2x M3 screws and heat inserts
* Two 1x8 right angle pin headers with 0.2 in pitch such as [Samtec TSW-208-25-T-S-RA](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/200-TSW20825TSRA)
* Wires for connecting PCB with pin headers

The case is designed to be printed with a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layer height.
